# Stories/Rubric (10 pts)
## ICDEP Proposals:

### (2 pts) Anti-Duplication (anti-dupe.md): How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?

### (6 pts) Extension (extension.md): How can we add additional features without breaking previous functionality? Consider:

- Send to any individual on the whole UW campus

- Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values

- Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through
Your extension mechanism should allow for any kind of extension we can imagine

### (2 pts) Administration (admin.md): How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?

These do not have to be provably correct--there's no time for that. Give it your best guess/shot, support it with your best logic.
