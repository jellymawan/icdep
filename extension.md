# Extension: How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?

## Send to any individual on the whole UW campus
### Solution 1:
- The person sending the message will say: "are you [recipient]?"
- If the answer is no, then the person (node) will take the message and pass it on. They will also ask: "are you [recipient]?" This process is repeated until the message reaches the recipient
- If the answer is yes, the recipient will read the message.

### Solution 2:
- The person sending the message will give the index card to someone who has relation to the recipient (i.e. is in their class, is their friend, etc)
- If the person does not know anyone who knows the recipient, they will randomly give the index card to a random person
- The random person will then repeat the two above steps
- This process is repeated until the recipient receives the index card

## Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values

## Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through.
