# Extension: How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?

## Send to any individual on the whole UW campus
### Solution:
- The person sending the message will say: "are you [recipient]?"
- If the answer is no, then the person (node) will take the message and pass it on. They will also ask: "are you [recipient]?" This process is repeated until the message reaches the recipient
- If the answer is yes, the recipient will read the message.

## Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values

## Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through.
